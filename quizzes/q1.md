# Q1

This is Q1, about cats.

This is the second line of text inside of Q1. It shouldn't be confused with the description of Q1.

Here's an image. I'm not sure how it will look.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/auto-continue hung.png" alt="this is the alt text"><figcaption><p>This is the caption text.</p></figcaption></figure>

This text shows below the caption.

{% hint style="info" %}
this is a hint
{% endhint %}

This text goes below the hint.
