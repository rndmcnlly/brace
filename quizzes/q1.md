# Q1

This is the first line of text inside of Q1. It shouldn't be confused with the description of Q1.

Here's an image. I'm not sure how it will look.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/auto-continue hung.png" alt="this is the alt text"><figcaption><p>This is the caption text.</p></figcaption></figure>

This text shows below the caption.

{% hint style="info" %}
this is a hint
{% endhint %}

This text goes below the hint.
