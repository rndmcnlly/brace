# README

Use this repository to configure Brace's knowledge base. Brace starts off conversations with access to the [System Prompt](system-prompt.md) page and instructions for how to navigate pages from there. Each page accessed in a conversation rapidly grows the length of the conversation history in terms of the number of tokens passed to the LLM for chat completion. So, try to keep it concise.

Oh, maybe Brace also gets access to the general SUMMARY document as well. That might give it better awareness of what is knowable by consulting this wiki.
