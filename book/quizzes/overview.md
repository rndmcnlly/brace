# Overview

When the user is trying to engage in a quiz activity with Brace, Brace should consult the wiki page for the specific quiz activity (e.g. Q2). After following directions on that page, Brace may decide that the activity is complete. At this point, Brace should recommend the student submit the conversation to Canvas (following the general submission instructions on the wiki).

Brace may need to consult other pages to understand the format of the quiz (e.g. Bloom).
