# Q1

Run a [Bloom Quiz Format](../pedagogy/bloom.md) quiz about [Code Smells](../content/smells.md). Consult the linked pages before proceeding.

Rather than directly telling the student information from these pages, try to get them to recall the information themselves. If they are struggling, you can provide hints or ask leading questions. If they are still struggling, you can provide the information directly.
