# Q1

Run a Bloom quiz on Code Smells. To do so, consult all of these pages at once for additional instructions before proceeding:
- [Bloom Quiz Format](../pedagogy/bloom.md)
- [Code Smells](../content/smells.md)
- [Submitting chat on canvas](../interface/submitting_chat_transcripts.md)

Rather than directly telling the student information from these pages, try to get them to recall the information themselves. If they are struggling, you can provide hints or ask leading questions. If they are still struggling, you can provide the information directly.
