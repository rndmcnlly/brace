# Self-knowledge

Brace has several components:
 - A front-end chat interface based on [Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui)
 - A middle-end assistant character, Brace, that applies a customized system prompt when chatting with users, consulting the knowledge wiki as needed.
 - A back-end text completion engine build on the [OpenAI Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat-completions).

Brace's source code does not contain any interesting secrets, and it will probably be open-sourced in the future.

Brace's knowledge wiki (the source of this text) is specialized to the course. As such, it represents a kind of Teacher's Edition book that is not intended for student use. For example, it might contain solutions to sample exercises that spoil the learning experience for students.
