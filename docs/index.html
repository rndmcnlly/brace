				<p><strong>Brace</strong> is an <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr>-powered course assistant
					created by Professor <a href="https://adamsmith.as">Adam Smith</a> to help with teaching
					feedback-intensive
					courses with large student populations. Unlike other LLM-based assistants, chats with Brace pull in
					instructor-authored content as needed in order to carry out activities and behaviors specific the
					the course. Brace integrates with the Canvas LMS in order to allow students to directly submit
					conversation transcripts.</p>

				<p><strong>What?</strong> It lets you have conversations like the one in <a
						href="https://gist.github.com/rndmcnlly/1aae659939e90eb798179aed2188b2b6">this transcript</a>
					from an early prototype of the system. It's <em>✨agentic✨</em>.</p>
				<p><strong>How are students reacting?</strong> Here's <a
						href="https://gist.github.com/rndmcnlly/537d82bffa62d2b7ae0767f896d4b6fb">a summary of student
						reactions</a> to a first assignment that <emph>required</emph> using Brace
					(for a structured interview that leads up to them configuring a personal system prompt for use in
					future chats).</p>
				<p><strong>Where can I audit the source code for Brace?</strong> The source code for this system
					can be found at <a href="https://github.com/rndmcnlly/brace">https://github.com/rndmcnlly/brace</a>.
					Because Brace can pull assignment descriptions and other text from Canvas, more and more of Brace's
					behavior is controlled by natural language instructions that are private to the community of the
					course and not visible on GitHub.

			<h2>Design Notes</h2>
			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Who pays for all this?</strong> It's just Adam Smith building and operating this thing. We
					spend about $12/month for the front-end server and $1.50/student/month for the back-end LLM service.
					Roughly, thats 20k input tokens (mostly cached) and 1k output tokens per student per day. We expect costs to drop to $0.25/student/month very soon.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Why is this on the <code>brace.tools</code> domain and not something more official like
						<code>brace.ucsc.edu</code>?</strong> It takes many meetings and approvals to set that up. I'm
					working through it.</li>
				<li><strong>Where is the data stored?</strong> Conversations are stored on Adam's server, and copies
					of some of them are submitted to the Canvas LMS via explicit student actions. Conversations may be
					temporarily stored by back-end LLM providers to speed up future text completion calls.</li>
				<li><strong>Who can access student conversations?</strong> The instructor is the only one
					who can access student chats on the server (and students cannot look at peer work, and TAs can only
					see chats submitted to Canvas).</li>
				<li><strong>How is this different from ChatGPT?</strong> A few important ways:
					<ol>
						<li>The system disguishes the roles of <em>students</em> and <em>teachers</em> and their
							relation to a specific <em>course</em> that organizes <em>assignments</em>.</li>
						<li>In a typical ChatGPT conversation, 80%-90% of the context window is filled with recycled
							AI-generated text. With Brace, about half is populated with instructor-written text
							specific to the course, and student code pulled from public repositories on GitHub
							further
							grounds the conversation in the student's work.</li>
						<li>When the LLM makes an embarassing mistake (e.g. regarding course content or pedagogical
							technique) the course staff can immediately fix this at the course level by editing the
							assistant's system
							prompt, wiki pages, or text on Canvas.</li>
						<li>Access to the top models or most comfortable rate limits is not gated by a student's
							wealth. All students get the best experience for free.</li>
						<li>Conversations stay within the <em>course</em>, and they are not sold or mined for others'
							commercial/institutional benefit.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li><strong>What data is used to train Brace?</strong> Brace has not been trained specifically for
					use in this course, and it only knows about the course via prompts (i.e. text injected into the
					LLM's context window). Brace works as a wrapper around pre-existing LLMs (which are each trained
					on their own peculiar and likely problematic sources of data).</li>
				<li><strong>Which LLM is Brace based on?</strong> Brace was developed using the
					<code>gpt-4o</code> model as the default back-end. However, it is easy for us to swap in
					alterantives. We are looking for alternatives that are strong (less likely to
					misbehave), not too costly, and less energy intensive. If monetary cost
					were no concern, we would still prefer a moderate-strength model to show that the largest models
					are not necessary for this application. See <a
						href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models">Artificial Analysis</a> for a report on the
					rapidly changing landscape of commercially-available LLM models and services.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Where can I listen to the <i>Brace</i> soundtrack?</strong> Enjoy these musical
					design-fiction tracks we created to keep us hyped
					during the system's development: <a
						href="https://suno.com/playlist/17839278-c248-4967-90be-796970592520">🎵 Brace playlist on
						Suno</a>.</li>
